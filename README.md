# calcucalc

A Rust library for doing calculus. 

This is very much a work in progress at this stage. Feel free to contribute any suggestions via a pull request. 

## Planning

One big problem which is worth mentioning is the set of problems that we are trying to solve. For example, do we need this program to be able to handle non-integer powers of x?

For now, this library will focus on solving basic cases first for the sake of simplicity, but refactoring may be necessary in the future in order to expand the scope of the library.
